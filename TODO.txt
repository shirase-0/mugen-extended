Scale2x - this is so I can make the sprites render at 2 times the size (which should be really helpful if I want to make it possible to have a fullscreen mode)
Sound - this should handle loading of all the music and sounds in the game
Character Definition Parser - this handles finding where all the character's specific files are, what they're called, which colour palette to choose, etc
Menu - this should handle all the menus in the game, allowing the player to choose arcade mode, survival mode, PvP mode, etc
Options - this should handle taking input from the user regarding their settings in the game (game difficulty, volume, etc)

Those are the main things I've thought out so far
There's way more features I have in mind, but I haven't worked out yet how I want to structure those and incorporate them in the engine
Some of those ideas would be:
-stage selection/loading
-specialised AI for each character
-online mode (PvP against real players around the world)
-develop a new character creation format that allows for better performace and more customisability
-make the engine easier to extend, allowing each new addition to be very modular
